# AoOptions
AoOptions library is a replacement for the Settings feature that comes with Visual Studio, offering XML persistence for user settings for desktop apps. The built-in Settings class tracks with the production version, causing users to lose their settings if the program version changes, which is terrible behavior in my opinion.
AoOptions has some methods that make it easy to save form sizes and positions.
